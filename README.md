# summer-project-2020

This year's summer videogame will be based on some of the ideas of [Gun Mayhem](https://gunmayhem.io/).

The background overall theme will be some random FEUP places and the characters will be based on the different fields of engineering.

Please install [this plugin](https://unity.github.com/) in Unity and let's hope it helps in not having merge conflits.
